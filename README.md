# Cisco-Packet-Tracer
The study involves demonstrate basic set up of a Cisco router, DHCP pool, and set up of a switch. Simple network with multiple devices connected to a hub, configuring their IP addresses, and observing data broadcasting using Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.1

# Lab 1
The goal in this lab is to be able to have two computers connect together. 
1. Cabling
2. Assign IP addressing and configuration
3. Testing connectivity

Started by clicking devices then picking a pc drag and drop, then picking a pc drag and drop. Then connect them using cable or wirelessly. With cable you go to connections then click once after pick a crossover cable. Then click crossover on PC0 then click once you go to that spot where you want to plug the network interface port in the FastEthernet. After you plug then go to the second PC1 click once on the network interface port in the FastEthernet. Set up IP addressing configuration enter, then subnet mask will come up automatically and then testing in the command prompt "ping" command followed by the address of the destination of PC1 then press Enter. Then you see a reply message coming from the destination PC followed byte 32 which is the size of the packet then followed by the time it took to send and come back.

# Lab 2
The goal in this lab is to be able to have multiple computers connect together with a switch. 
1. Connection of multiple computers using a switch
2. Assign IP addressing and configuration
3. Testing connectivity

Started by clicking drag and drop until you have four computers. Then click on the network devices you click down on a 2960 switch, click on switch to see how the switch is set up looks like. After click out and click on connections, then pick the copper straight cable plug it into a PC0 click once on the FastEthernet connect to the switch click once on the FastEthernet. Then repeat until all four computers are connected to the switch. Set up IP addressing configuration enter, then subnet mask will come up automatically and then you go to every computer you go on top and you give them all an IP addresses. after testing in the command prompt "ping" command followed by the address of the destination of PC1 then press Enter. Then you see a reply message coming from the destination PC followed byte 32 which is the size of the packet then followed by the time it took to send and come back. Then you can see packets: sent, received, lost.

# Lab 3
The goal in this lab is to be able to have multiple computers connect together to a hub. 
1. Connection of multiple computers using a hub
2. Assign IP addressing and configuration
3. Testing connectivity
   
Started by dragging and dropping three computers onto the workspace. Then, select a hub from the network devices and place it in the workspace. Connect each computer to the hub using copper straight cables. Click on the first computer, select the FastEthernet port, and connect it to the hub. Repeat this for the other two computers. After all computers are connected, assign IP addresses to each computer, ensuring that subnet come up automatically . Finally, test connectivity using the "ping" command from one computer to another. You should see a reply message indicating successful communication.

# Lab 4
The goal in this lab is to have two computers connect together with a switch and connected to a rounter2.
1. Connection of multiple computers using a switch and rounter2
2. Assign IP addressing and configuration
3. Testing connectivity

Started by dragging and dropping two computers and a switch onto the workspace. Next, add a router to the setup. Connect each computer to the switch using copper straight cables. Then, connect the switch to the router. Assign IP addresses to both computers and set up the gateway, ensuring they are in the same subnet. Finally, test connectivity by using ipconfig on all on computers to check the info, then "ping" command from one computer to the other. You should see a reply message confirming successful communication.

# Lab 5
The goal in this lab is to have two computers using switch0, router2, and two computers using switch2, router3, then connect router to router.  
1. Connection of two networks using switches and routers
2. Assign IP addressing and configuration
3. Testing connectivity

Started by placing two computers and switch0 in the workspace. Connect switch0 to router2. Then, place another two computers and switch2, connecting switch2 to router3. Use copper straight cables to connect the computers to their respective switches. Then connect the switches to their respective routers with using a crossover cable. Set up the configure them and serial port on the routers for IP addresses. Assign IP addresses to all computers, ensuring they are in the same subnet for their respective switches. Finally, test connectivity between the two networks using the "ping" command from one computer in switch0 to a computer in switch2. You should see a reply message indicating successful communication.

# Lab 6
The goal in this lab is to have two computers using switch0, rounter2, and two computers using switch2, router3 then connect router to router. 
1. Connection of two networks using switches and routers
2. Assign IP addressing and configuration
3. Testing connectivity

Started by placing two computers and switch0 in the workspace, connecting switch0 to router2 using select the FastEthernet port. Then, add another two computers and switch2, connecting switch2 to router3 using select the FastEthernet port. Checking the physical set up on router3.Use copper straight cables to connect the computers to their respective switches. Set up the configure them and serial port on the routers for IP addresses. Set up RIP rounting for the network address for routers. Assign IP addresses to all computers, ensuring they are in the same subnet for their respective switches. Finally, test connectivity between the two networks using the "ping" command from one computer in switch0 to a computer in switch2. You should see a reply message confirming successful communication.

# Lab 7
The goal in this lab is to have three computers connected together using switch3 and two computers configured using VLAN2, one computers configured. using VLAN3 then connect.
1. Connection of three computers using switch3
2. Assign IP addressing and configuration VLAN2 and VLAN3
3. Testing connectivity

Started by dragging and dropping three computers onto the workspace and placing switch3. Connect the three computers to switch3 using copper straight cables we select the FastEthernet port. Next, configure VLAN2 for two of the computers and VLAN3 for the third computer. Assign appropriate IP addresses for each VLAN. Finally, test connectivity by using the "ping" command from one computer in VLAN2 to the other computer in VLAN2 and from VLAN2 to VLAN3. You should see reply messages confirming successful communication.
